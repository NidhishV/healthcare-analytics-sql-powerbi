# Healthcare Analytics & Decision Support Dashboard  

## Introduction  
Healthcare institutions generate large volumes of data across patient care, operations, and finances. Often, this data is siloed and underutilized, limiting its value in decision-making.  

The **Healthcare Analytics & Decision Support Dashboard** integrates patient, clinical, hospital, and financial data into a unified analytics platform. Using **SQL** for backend queries and **Power BI** for visualization, the dashboard empowers administrators, doctors, and finance teams to make **data-driven decisions** with real-time insights.
